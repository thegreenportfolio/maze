  <h1>Learning Maze – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: January 26, 2026</em></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Learning Maze (“the App”) is a maze-based educational game that combines exploration with short
    knowledge questions. We designed it to be simple, fun, and respectful of your privacy.
    This policy explains what information is (and is not) collected when you use the App.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>We do not require accounts</strong> and we do not ask you to enter personal information.</p>

  <p>The App may collect limited information through third-party services if enabled in the App build:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Advertising (AdMob):</strong> the App may display ads.
      Ad providers may collect device information to serve and measure ads.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>In-App Purchases:</strong> if you purchase an upgrade (for example, to unlock the full game
      or remove ads), Apple processes the payment. We do not receive your payment details.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>3. Game Data</h2>
  <p>
    Game progress (such as completed levels, topic selection, difficulty settings, and preferences)
    is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
    You can remove this data at any time by deleting the App.
  </p>

  <h2>4. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>
    If the App displays ads, it uses Google AdMob (Google Mobile Ads).
    These services may collect information as described in their own privacy policies.
    You can review Google’s policy here:

    </a>.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is intended for a general audience.
    We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.
    If you believe that a child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can address the issue.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Changes</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy if the App changes.
    Any updates will be posted at the same URL.
