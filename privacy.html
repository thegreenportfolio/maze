  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    Learning Maze (“the App”) is a maze-based educational game that combines exploration with short
    knowledge questions. We designed it to be simple, fun, and respectful of your privacy.

    Learning Maze offers an optional, one-time, non-consumable in-app purchase to unlock the full game.
    All payments are processed securely by Apple via the App Store.

    We do not receive or store payment information, billing details, or Apple ID data.

    Game progress (such as completed levels, selected topics, difficulty settings, and preferences)
    is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.

    You can remove all locally stored data at any time by deleting the App.
